# Fluorescence Spectroscopy

This repository provides tools for processing and analyzing fluorescence spectroscopy data. Fluorescence spectroscopy is widely used to study molecular environments, concentrations, interactions, and dynamics in chemistry, biology, and materials science.

## Overview

The program reads raw data and uses user-defined settings to perform fitting, baseline correction, and/or peak deconvolution. The main components include:

* **Raw Data Input** : Accepts standard data files.
* **Output** : Generates processed plots, fit results, and summary tables.
