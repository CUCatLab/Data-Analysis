# Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy

This repository provides tools for processing and analyzing Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy data. CD spectroscopy is a sensitive technique used to investigate the secondary structure of chiral molecules, particularly proteins and nucleic acids, by measuring the differential absorption of left- and right-circularly polarized light.

## Overview

The program reads raw data and uses user-defined settings to perform fitting, baseline correction, and/or peak deconvolution. The main components include:

* **Raw Data Input** : Accepts standard data files.
* **Output** : Generates processed plots, fit results, and summary tables.
